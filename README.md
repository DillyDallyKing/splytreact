# SplytReact

The SplytReact app is built on React.
It uses React-Map-Gl, React-Compound-Slider and Axios.

## Basic Overview - [SplytReact - Demo](http://splytreact.surge.sh/)

SplytReact is a simple prototype app which shows the up to date relative location of available taxis around **SplytHQ** (latitude=51.5049375 & longitude=-0.0964509).

Users are able to drag the slider bar to increase or reduce the number of available taxis shown on the map.

The Polling button can be toggled on & off in order to start a 3 second polling of the API service to update the location of the available taxis.

#### Requirements

- Node.js
- Npm

## Building & Running it

1. Open terminal & run `npm install` in the main app directory `SplytReact`.
